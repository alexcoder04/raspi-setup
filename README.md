# raspi-setup

A script I would run to setup my Raspberry Pi. Actually, I haven't to setup a
Raspberry since I wrote this script, so it's untested.

## Warning

Some features are still missing and bugs are expected.

Always read carefully what the script says and continue only if you are sure
that it's okay.
